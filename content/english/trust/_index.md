## Our Commitment to Trust

Trust is the foundation of our client relationships. When organizations engage CatDev for security assessments, infrastructure work, or managed services, they're granting us access to sensitive systems and information. We take that trust seriously.

**Transparency**

We believe in open communication about our practices, capabilities, and limitations. This page exists to give you visibility into how we operate. If you have questions not answered here, ask us directly.

**Accountability**

We hold ourselves accountable for meeting the commitments we make. When things go wrong, and sometimes they will, we communicate promptly, take responsibility, and focus on resolution and prevention.

**Continuous Improvement**

Security is not a destination. We continuously evaluate and improve our practices based on emerging threats, new standards, and lessons learned from our work.

## Working With Your Security Team

We understand that engaging an external partner raises security questions. We're happy to:

- Complete security questionnaires
- Provide documentation of our security practices
- Participate in vendor security assessments
- Sign appropriate NDAs and data processing agreements
- Work within your security requirements and constraints

If you have specific security requirements for vendor engagements, let us know early in our discussions so we can address them.
