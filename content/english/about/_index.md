## Who We Are

CatDev is an IT services company that combines broad technical expertise with a security-first mindset. Founded in 2019 and headquartered in Estonia, we serve clients globally through a remote-first operating model that lets us bring the best talent to every engagement.

We started with a focus on cybersecurity, penetration testing and security assessments, and have expanded to cover the full spectrum of IT services that modern organizations need: cloud platforms, AI systems, software development, DevOps, and managed services. What hasn't changed is our commitment to quality, security, and transparent partnerships.

## What Makes Us Different

**We're Not an Agency**

We don't have account managers, sales teams, or layers of project managers between you and the engineers doing the work. When you work with CatDev, you work directly with senior engineers who understand your systems and can make informed decisions.

**Security is in Our DNA**

Our roots in cybersecurity mean that security considerations are natural to us. Whether we're building an application, designing cloud infrastructure, or deploying an AI system, security is built in from the start, not bolted on at the end.

**We Tell You the Truth**

Consulting relationships often suffer from telling clients what they want to hear. We believe that honest, direct feedback is more valuable than comfortable agreements. If something won't work, we'll say so. If there's a better approach, we'll suggest it.

**We Build for the Long Term**

Quick fixes and shortcuts create technical debt that costs more in the long run. We build solutions designed to be maintained, extended, and operated over time. Our goal is your long-term success, not just project completion.

## Our Approach

Every engagement starts with understanding. We take time to learn your business context, technical environment, and specific challenges before proposing solutions. This discovery phase ensures that what we build actually addresses your needs.

We work iteratively, delivering value incrementally rather than disappearing for months before a big reveal. Regular communication keeps you informed and allows for course correction when needed.

Knowledge transfer is built into every engagement. We don't create dependency through obscurity. Your team learns alongside ours, and documentation ensures you can maintain and extend what we build.

## Working With Us

We engage with clients in several ways:

**Project-Based Work**: Defined scope engagements with clear deliverables, timeline, and fixed pricing.

**Retained Services**: Ongoing access to our engineering team for support, advisory, and hands-on work as needed.

**Managed Services**: Full operational responsibility for your infrastructure or applications with defined SLAs.

Whatever the engagement model, you can expect senior engineers, transparent communication, and a genuine focus on your success.
