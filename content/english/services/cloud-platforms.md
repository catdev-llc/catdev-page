overview:
  title: "Enterprise File Sharing Under Your Control"
  content: |
    Public cloud storage isn't an option for every organization. Whether due to compliance requirements, data sovereignty concerns, or simply the need for full control over your data, self-hosted file sharing platforms provide a powerful alternative.

    CatDev specializes in deploying, integrating, and managing enterprise file sharing solutions that give you the collaboration features your teams need without sacrificing security or control.
  benefits:
    - "Full control over your data and where it's stored"
    - "Integration with existing identity providers (LDAP, SAML, OIDC)"
    - "Compliance with data residency and sovereignty requirements"
    - "Enterprise features: audit logging, retention policies, workflows"
    - "Reduced dependency on third-party cloud providers"

## Why Self-Hosted File Sharing?

**Data Sovereignty**
Your data stays in your infrastructure, in your jurisdiction. No third-party access, no questions about where data is processed or stored.

**Compliance Made Easier**
Full audit logging, configurable retention policies, and complete control over access permissions simplify compliance with regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and industry-specific requirements.

**Total Cost Visibility**
Predictable infrastructure costs instead of per-user SaaS pricing that scales unpredictably as your organization grows.

**Customization and Integration**
Self-hosted platforms can be deeply integrated with your existing systems and customized to match your specific workflows.
