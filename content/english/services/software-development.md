    Custom software should be an asset, not a liability. Too often, projects become difficult to maintain, expensive to change, or impossible to scale. At CatDev, we build software with a long-term perspective, applying modern engineering practices that result in systems your team can understand, maintain, and evolve.

    Whether you need a new application, integration with existing systems, or technical advisory on architecture decisions, our senior engineers bring the experience to deliver quality results.
  benefits:
    - "Clean, maintainable code that your team can understand"
    - "Modern architecture patterns that scale with your needs"
    - "Comprehensive testing for confidence in deployments"
    - "Clear documentation and knowledge transfer"
    - "Security considerations built in from the start"

## How We Build Software

**Quality Over Speed**
We don't cut corners to hit artificial deadlines. Sustainable development pace produces better results than rushed work that creates technical debt.

**Test-Driven Development**
We write tests alongside code, not as an afterthought. This approach catches bugs early and provides confidence for future changes.

**Continuous Integration**
Every change is automatically built, tested, and validated. Problems are caught early when they're cheap to fix.

**Documentation That Matters**
We document architecture decisions, API contracts, and operational procedures. Not every line of code, but the things that matter for long-term maintenance.
