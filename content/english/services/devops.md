  title: "Infrastructure That Enables Velocity"
  content: |
    DevOps isn't just about tools. It's about enabling your organization to deliver software faster and more reliably. We help teams build the automation, observability, and practices that turn deployment from a stressful event into a routine operation.

    Whether you're starting from manual deployments or looking to mature your existing practices, CatDev brings the experience to design and implement DevOps capabilities that fit your organization.
  benefits:
    - "Faster, more reliable software deployments"
    - "Infrastructure defined and versioned as code"
    - "Visibility into system health and performance"
    - "Reduced operational toil through automation"
    - "Improved collaboration between development and operations"

## Our DevOps Philosophy

**Automation Over Documentation**
If a process can be automated, it should be. Runbooks are a last resort, not a default solution.

**Observability is Non-Negotiable**
You can't improve what you can't measure. Comprehensive monitoring and logging are foundational, not optional.

**Small Changes, Frequently**
Large, infrequent deployments are risky. Small, frequent changes are easier to test, deploy, and roll back if needed.

**Blameless Culture**
Incidents are learning opportunities. We help establish practices that focus on system improvement rather than individual blame.
