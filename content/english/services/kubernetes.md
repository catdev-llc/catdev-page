  title: "Container Platforms That Scale"
  content: |
    Kubernetes has become the standard for running containerized workloads, but running Kubernetes well requires significant expertise. From initial cluster design to day-2 operations, there are countless decisions that affect reliability, security, and cost.

    CatDev helps organizations build and operate Kubernetes platforms that provide a solid foundation for application delivery. Whether you're deploying your first cluster or optimizing an existing platform, we bring the experience to make Kubernetes work for your organization.
  benefits:
    - "Production-grade cluster architecture"
    - "Security hardening and policy enforcement"
    - "Efficient resource utilization and cost management"
    - "Developer-friendly platform experience"
    - "Operational procedures and runbooks"

## Our Kubernetes Philosophy

**Platform, Not Just Cluster**
A Kubernetes cluster is just infrastructure. A platform provides the abstractions, automation, and guardrails that make developers productive and operations sustainable.

**Security is Foundational**
Kubernetes security is complex and often overlooked. We implement security controls from the start, not as an afterthought.

**Operational Excellence**
A cluster that can't be upgraded, monitored, or debugged isn't production-ready. We build with operations in mind from day one.

**Right-Sized Complexity**
Not every organization needs a complex platform. We help you find the right level of sophistication for your team and workloads.
