## Migration Philosophy

**Business Outcomes First**
Migration isn't the goal, it's a means to achieve business outcomes. We start with understanding what you want to accomplish and design the migration accordingly.

**Risk Management**
Every migration involves risk. We identify risks early, plan mitigations, and execute in ways that minimize exposure through careful staging and rollback capabilities.

**Right-Sizing from Day One**
Cloud costs can spiral quickly. We help you right-size resources from the start and establish practices for ongoing cost optimization.

**Skills Transfer**
A successful migration leaves your team capable of operating in the new environment. Knowledge transfer is built into every engagement.
