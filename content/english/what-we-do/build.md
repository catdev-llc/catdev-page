  content: |
    Building new systems is where strategy meets execution. Whether you're developing custom software, deploying AI capabilities, or building container platforms, we apply modern engineering practices to create solutions that work reliably in production, not just in demos.

    Our BUILD capabilities cover the complete development lifecycle: architecture design, implementation, testing, deployment, and handoff to operations.

    - title: "Technical Debt Reduction"
      description: "Existing systems have accumulated technical debt. You need senior engineers who can refactor, improve code quality, and establish better practices."

# Our Approach
approach:
  title: "How We Approach BUILD Projects"
  subtitle: "A structured methodology that balances speed with sustainability"
  phases:
    - title: "Architecture & Design"
      description: "We start with understanding your requirements, constraints, and success criteria. This phase produces technical architecture, technology selection, and implementation roadmap."
      deliverables:
        - "Technical architecture documentation"
        - "Technology stack recommendations"
        - "System design and data models"
        - "Implementation roadmap with milestones"

    - title: "Development & Testing"
      description: "Iterative development with regular check-ins and demonstrations. We build in short cycles, validate frequently, and adjust based on feedback."
      practices:
        - "Test-driven development"
        - "Code review and pair programming"
        - "Continuous integration"
        - "Security scanning and vulnerability management"

    - title: "Deployment & Handoff"
      description: "We don't just build and disappear. Proper deployment includes infrastructure setup, monitoring configuration, documentation, and knowledge transfer."
      deliverables:
        - "Production deployment"
        - "Monitoring and alerting configuration"
        - "Operational runbooks"
        - "Knowledge transfer sessions"

# Engineering Standards

## What Makes Our BUILD Approach Different

**Senior Engineers From Day One**
No junior developers learning on your project. Every BUILD engagement is staffed with experienced engineers who have built similar systems before.

**Production Mindset**
We don't just write code that works on developer laptops. We build systems designed to run reliably in production with proper monitoring, error handling, and operational considerations.

**Security Embedded**
Security isn't added at the end. It's part of architecture design, code review processes, and deployment practices from the first sprint.

**Clear Communication**
You'll understand what we're building, why we made specific technical decisions, and what trade-offs we considered. No black-box development.

**Sustainable Code Quality**
We write code that can be maintained by future teams (including yours). This means readable code, comprehensive tests, and thorough documentation.
