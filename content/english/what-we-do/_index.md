    Most IT service providers force you to work with multiple teams, coordinate handoffs, and manage vendor relationships. CatDev is different. We provide end-to-end capabilities organized around four core pillars that cover the complete technology lifecycle.

# Four Pillars Overview
pillars:
  - title: "BUILD"
    icon: "fa-solid fa-code"
    tagline: "Create systems that solve real problems"
    description: "Custom software, AI integrations, and container platforms built with modern engineering practices. We design and develop production-ready systems from the ground up."
    capabilities:

      - name: "Kubernetes & Container Platforms"
        link: "/services/kubernetes/"
    link: "/what-we-do/build/"
    color: "blue"

  - title: "OPERATE"
    icon: "fa-solid fa-gears"
    tagline: "Run infrastructure reliably at any scale"
    description: "DevOps automation, platform engineering, and managed services that keep your systems running securely. We handle the day-to-day operations so you can focus on your core business."
    capabilities:

      - name: "Cloud File & Collaboration Platforms"

    link: "/what-we-do/operate/"
    color: "green"

  - title: "TRANSFORM"
    icon: "fa-solid fa-cloud-arrow-up"
    tagline: "Modernize without disrupting your business"
    description: "Cloud migrations, application modernization, and infrastructure redesign. We move you from legacy systems to modern platforms with clear planning and minimal risk."

  - title: "SECURE"
    icon: "fa-solid fa-shield-halved"

# Why This Approach Works
approach:
  title: "Why the Four Pillars Approach Works"
  content: |
    Traditional IT service providers are organized around their internal structure, not your needs. You have to coordinate between different teams, manage handoffs, and hope everyone stays aligned.

    Our Four Pillars framework puts you in control. Need to build a new system and secure it? We handle both. Running a migration that requires DevOps automation and ongoing operations? One team, one engagement, seamless execution.
  benefits:
    - title: "No Vendor Coordination"
      description: "One point of contact, one team that understands your complete environment. No finger-pointing between providers when something goes wrong."
      icon: "fa-solid fa-users"

    - title: "Consistent Standards"
      description: "The same security practices, coding standards, and operational discipline across every pillar. Your systems are built, operated, and secured with unified best practices."
      icon: "fa-solid fa-check-double"

    - title: "Faster Execution"
      description: "No time wasted on handoffs, knowledge transfer, or getting new vendors up to speed. We move from design to deployment without organizational friction."
      icon: "fa-solid fa-gauge-high"

    - title: "Strategic Continuity"
      description: "We understand how your systems evolved because we were there. No need to re-explain context or justify past decisions to new providers."
      icon: "fa-solid fa-timeline"

## How We're Different

**Full-Stack Capability Without the Enterprise Overhead**
We provide the same comprehensive capabilities as large consulting firms, but with senior engineers who do the work, not junior teams managed by layers of project managers.

**Security Embedded, Not Added Later**
Security isn't a separate pillar you bolt on at the end. It's integrated into how we BUILD, OPERATE, and TRANSFORM systems from day one.

**Practical Engineering, Not Theoretical Consulting**
We don't hand you a strategy deck and walk away. We design, implement, and operate real systems in production environments with real constraints.

**Long-Term Partnership Model**
Most projects reveal additional needs once you start. Our four pillars give you a clear path to expand the relationship without bringing in new vendors.
